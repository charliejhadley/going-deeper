## Importing Data

---

### Downloading Data Directly

The `download.file()` function lets us download files directly from websites.

```{r}
download.file(url, destfile = "data/name-of-file.xlsx")
```

???

Benefit = reproducibility

---

### Importing Excel Files

1. I'll create a new project

---

class: inverse

### My Turn (continued)

I'll be working with the following data:

1. [State of Oregon 2018-2019 school attendance data](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/reports-and-data/students/Documents/fallmembershipreport_20182019.xlsx)

2. [State of Oregon 2018-2019 3rd grade math proficiency data](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/reports-and-data/students/Documents/regularattenders_report_1819.xlsx)

--

I'll do the following:

1. Download the two files above manually and put them in the data folder

--

1. Download the two files above using the download.file() function (in the process, I'll overwrite the files I downloaded before)

--

1. Create a new R script file where I'll do my data importing, wrangling, and cleaning, and import the files into two data frames

--

1. Import the data into two data frames (`math_scores` and `attendance`)

--

I'm ultimately going to compare third grade math scores and rates of chronic absenteeism.

---

## Tidy Data

---

### The Three Rules of Tidy Data

--

1. Each variable forms a column.

--

2. Each observation forms a row.

--

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

--

*We'll focus on #1 and #3. To read about examples of untidy data, check out the [Tidy Data vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html).*

---

class: inverse

### My Turn

Let's take a look at my data and see which principles of tidy data it violates

## Reshaping Data

---

### Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

The `pivot_longer()` function helps us in situations where column headers are values, not variable names.

--

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use) #<<
```

--

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use,
               names_to = "name_of_identifer_variable") #<<
```

--

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use,
               names_to = "name_of_identifer_variable",
               values_to = "name_of_value_variable") #<<
```


---

### Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
german_speakers
```

---

### Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r pivot_longer_example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state)
```

--

```{r ref.label = "pivot_longer_example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```


---

### Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", #<<
               values_to = "number") #<<
```

---

### Reshaping Data: `pivot_wider()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "state", #<<
              values_from = "number") #<<
```

???

I mostly use it to present data in tables

---

class: inverse

### My Turn

I'll do the following to create a new data frame called `math_percent_not_proficient`: 

--

1. Use `filter()` to only keep rows where the `student_group` variable is "Total Population (All Students)"

--

1. Use `filter()` to only keep third grade students

--

1. Use `select()` to only keep variables related to percent of students who are proficient

--

1. Use `pivot_longer()` to make my data frame tidy

---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

Do the following to create a new data frame called `enrollment_by_race`: 

--

1. select() the variables from county to district as well as all variables about grade (hint: use the [`contains()` helper function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html#useful-functions) within `select()`)

--

1. Use `pivot_longer()` to convert all of the grade variables into one variable

--

1. Within `pivot_longer()`, use the names_to argument to call that variable `race_ethnicity`

--

1. Within `pivot_longer()`, use the values_to argument to call that variable `number_of_students`


---

## Dealing with Missing Data

---

### Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number")
```

---

### Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) #<<
```

---

### Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) #<<
```


???

The `na_if()` function turns values that represent missing data into actual NAs

You can also do this with na arguments in read_excel etc

---

### Dealing with Missing Data: `replace_na()`


```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) #<<
```

???

The `replace_na()` function does the opposite: turns NAs into values.


---

class: inverse

### My Turn

1. Convert all of the missing values (they should show up as "-") in the `percent_proficient` variable to NA using `na_if()`

*I don't have any values where using `replace_na()` makes sense, but you'll use it shortly!*

---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

--

1. Convert all of the missing values (they should show up as "-") in the `number_of_students` variable to NA using `na_if()`

--

1. Convert all of the NA values you just made to 0 using `replace_na()`.

---

class: inverse, center, middle, dk-section-title

## Changing Variable Types

---

### Changing Variable Types

```{r}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(number))
```

--

<p class="error-text">Error in sum(number) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument</p>

---

### Changing Variable Types

To change variable types, you use the `mutate()` function combined with `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, etc.

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% #<<
  summarize(total = sum(number))
```


---

class: inverse

### My Turn

Convert the `percent_proficient` variable to numeric by using `as.numeric()`

---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

--

1. Convert the `number_of_students` variable to numeric by using `as.numeric()`

--

1. Use `mutate()` to calculate a new variable called `pct` that is the percent of the total enrollment for students in each race/ethnicity group

## Advanced Variable Creation

---

### `recode()`

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  mutate(var = recode(variable, "old_value" = "new_value"))
```

---

### `recode()`


```{r recode-example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% 
  mutate(year = recode(year, 
                       "2017-number-of-german-speakers" = "2017", #<<
                       "2018-number-of-german-speakers" = "2018", #<<
                       "2019-number-of-german-speakers" = "2019")) #<<
```

---

### `recode()`

```{r ref.label = "recode-example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```

---

### `if_else()`

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  mutate(var = if_else(variable == "some_value", "if_true_value" = "else_value"))
```

---

### `if_else()`

```{r if_else-example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% 
  mutate(year = if_else(year == "2017-number-of-german-speakers", "2017", year)) %>% #<<
  mutate(year = if_else(year == "2018-number-of-german-speakers", "2018", year)) %>% #<<
  mutate(year = if_else(year == "2019-number-of-german-speakers", "2019", year)) #<<

```

---

### `if_else()`

```{r ref.label = "if_else-example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```


---

### `case_when()`

```{r}
data_frame %>% 
  mutate(var = case_when(
    variable == "some_value" ~ "new_value",
    variable == "some_other_value" ~ "new_value_2",
    variable == "some_third_value" ~ "new_value_3",
    TRUE ~ "value_for_all_observations_that_dont_match_any_above_criteria"
  ))
```

---



### `case_when()`

```{r case_when-example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% 
  mutate(year = case_when( #<<
    year == "2017-number-of-german-speakers" ~ "2017", #<<
    year == "2018-number-of-german-speakers" ~ "2018", #<<
    year == "2019-number-of-german-speakers" ~ "2019" #<<
  )) #<<

```

---

### `case_when()`

```{r ref.label = "case_when-example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```

---

### More complicated `case_when()`

```{r case_when-complicated-example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% 
  mutate(number_categorical = case_when( #<<
    number < 500 ~ "Less than 500", #<<
    between(number, 500, 1000) ~ "Between 500 and 1000", #<<
    number > 1000 ~ "Greater than 1000" #<<
  )) #<<

```

---

### More complicated `case_when()`

```{r ref.label = "case_when-complicated-example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```


---

class: inverse

### My Turn

Convert all instances of the `proficiency_level` variable to more meaningful observations using: 

1. `recode()`

2. `if_else()`

3. `case_when()`

---

class: inverse

### My Turn

Convert all instances of the `race_ethnicity` variable to more meaningful observations (e.g. turn "x2018_19_asian" into "Asian") using any of the follwoing:

1. `recode()`

2. `if_else()`

3. `case_when()`

### Joins

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = "id_variable")
```

--

What if we don't have a variable with the same name in both data frames?

--

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = c("id_variable_x" = "id_variable_y")
```

--

What if we need to join on multiple variables with different names in both data frames?

--

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = c("id_variable_a" = "id_variable_b",
                        "id_variable_c" = "id_variable_d")
```


---

### Mutating joins

> A mutating join allows you to combine variables from two tables. It first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one table to the other. - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#mutating-joins)

---

#### `left_join()`

All rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns.

.center[
![](images/left-join.gif)
]



---

#### `left_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
left_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```

---

#### `right_join()`

All rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns.
.center[
![](images/right-join.gif)
]



---

#### `right_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
right_join(german_speakers_2019,
           french_speakers_2019,
           by = "state")
```

---

#### `full_join()`

All rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.
.center[
![](images/full-join.gif)
]

---

#### `full_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
full_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```


---

#### `inner_join()`

All rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.
.center[
![](images/inner-join.gif)

---

#### `inner_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
inner_join(german_speakers_2019,
           french_speakers_2019,
           by = "state")
```

---

### Filtering joins

> Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins)

---

#### `semi_join()`

All rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
.center[
![](images/semi-join.gif)
]

---

#### `semi_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
semi_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```

---

#### `anti_join()`

All rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.

class: inverse

### My Turn

1. Create a new data frame called `chronic_absenteeism` by starting with the attendance data frame and using the data wrangling skills we just learned

1. Join it with the `math_percent_not_proficient` data frame



---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

Before doing our join, we'll need to create a new data frame called `reading_scores_by_race` by importing the reading scores data that you downloaded previously. Use the `read_excel()` function to do this.


---

class: inverse

### Your Turn (continued)

After you've imported your data, do the following:

  - Use the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package to give you nice variable names
  
  - `filter()` using the `grade_level` to only include "All Grades"
  
  - `filter()` using the `student_group` variable to only include the following groups ("American Indian/Alaskan Native", "Asian", "Black/African American", "Hispanic/Latino", "Multi-Racial", "Pacific Islander", or "White")
  
  - `select()` the following variables: `district_id`, `student_group`, `percent_proficient_level_3_or_4`
  
  - Divide the `percent_proficient_level_3_or_4` variable by 100 (you'll need to convert this variable to a numeric first to make this work)


---

class: inverse

### Your Turn (continued)

Create a new data frame called `enrollment_and_reading_scores_by_race` by mmerging the `enrollment_by_race` and `reading_scores_by_race` data frames using `left_join()`. 

You are joining on two separate things (district ID and race/ethnicity group), each of which has different names in the two data frames. You'll need to use the following format to do this matching on multiple columns.

```{r}
new_data_frame <- left_join(data_frame_1, data_frame_2,
                            by = ("variable_1" = "variable_2",
                                  "variable_3" = "variable_4"))
```

```

--

```{r ref.label = "set_names_example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```


---

class: inverse

### My Turn

I'll use `rename()` and/or `set_names()` to give the `math_scores_chronic_absenteeism` data frame more meaningful names.
