class: my-turn

## My Turn

Throughout, I'll be working with [data on third grade math proficiency in Oregon schools](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/Pages/Assessment-Group-Reports.aspx).

I'll do the following:

1. Create a new project

--

1. Create a new R script file where I'll do all of my data cleaning work

--

1. Download math proficiency scores from 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 and put them in a data-raw folder

--

1. Import the two spreadsheets into two data frames (`math_scores_17_18` and `math_scores_18_19`)



---

class: inverse

## Your Turn


You'll be working with data on [Oregon school enrollment by race/ethnicity](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/reports-and-data/students/Pages/Student-Enrollment-Reports.aspx).

???

The tidyverse wants data in a certain format: tidy. With data in this format, it becomes much easier to work with. 

---

## The Three Rules of Tidy Data

--

1. Each variable forms a column.

--

2. Each observation forms a row.

--

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

--

*We'll focus on #1 and #3. To read about examples of untidy data, check out the [Tidy Data vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html).*

# Reshaping Data

---

## Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

The `pivot_longer()` function helps us in situations where column headers are values, not variable names.

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use) #<<
```

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use,
               names_to = "name_of_identifer_variable") #<<
```

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
data_frame %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = columns_to_use,
               names_to = "name_of_identifer_variable",
               values_to = "name_of_value_variable") #<<
```


---

## Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
german_speakers
```

---

## Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r pivot_longer_example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state)
```

--

```{r ref.label = "pivot_longer_example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```


---

## Reshaping Data: `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", #<<
               values_to = "number") #<<
```

---

## Reshaping Data: `pivot_wider()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "state", #<<
              values_from = "number") #<<
```

???

I mostly use it to present data in tables

---

class: my-turn

## My Turn

I'll do the following to create a new data frame called `third_grade_math_proficiency_18_19`: 

--

1. Use `filter()` to only keep rows where the `student_group` variable is "Total Population (All Students)"

--

1. Use `filter()` to only keep third grade students

--

1. Use `select()` to only keep variables related to the **number** (not percentage) of students who are proficient in math

--

1. Use `pivot_longer()` to make my data frame tidy

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

Do the following to create a new data frame called `enrollment_by_race_ethnicity_18_19`: 

--

1. Start with the `enrollment_18_19` data frame

--

1. select() the `district_id` variable as well as those about race/ethnicity and get rid of all others (hint: use the [`contains()` helper function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html#useful-functions) within `select()`)

--

1. Use `pivot_longer()` to convert all of the grade variables into one variable

--

1. Within `pivot_longer()`, use the names_to argument to call that variable `race_ethnicity`

--

1. Within `pivot_longer()`, use the values_to argument to call that variable `number_of_students`

# Dealing with Missing Data

---

## Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number")
```

---

## Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r german_speakers_na_if}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) #<<
```

---

## Dealing with Missing Data: `na_if()`

```{r ref.label = "german_speakers_na_if", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```


???

The `na_if()` function turns values that represent missing data into actual NAs

You can also do this with na arguments in read_excel etc

---

## Dealing with Missing Data: `replace_na()`


```{r replace_na_example}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) #<<
```

???

The `replace_na()` function does the opposite: turns NAs into values.


---


## Dealing with Missing Data: `replace_na()`


```{r ref.label = "replace_na_example", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```

---

class: my-turn

## My Turn

1. Convert all of the missing values in the `number_proficient` variable to NA using `na_if()`

*I don't have any values where using `replace_na()` makes sense, but you'll use it shortly!*

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

--

1. Convert all of the missing values in the `number_of_students` variable to NA using `na_if()`

--

1. Convert all of the NA values you just made to 0 using `replace_na()`.

# Changing Variable Types

## Changing Variable Types

```{r error = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(number))
```

---

## Changing Variable Types

To change variable types, you use the `mutate()` function combined with `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, etc.

```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>%

class: my-turn

## My Turn

I'll import 2017-2018 math proficiency data and then use bind_rows() to make a `third_grade_math_proficiency` data frame.

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

1. Import 2017-2018 enrollment data into a data frame called `enrollment_by_race_ethnicity_17_18` and clean it using the code you used for the 2018-2019 data

2. Use bind_rows() to make a `enrollment_by_race_ethnicity` data frame.

# Functions

---

## Why Use Functions?

1. You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.

--

1. As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.

--

1. You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

Source: [R for Data Science, Chapter 19](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)
]


---

## When to Use Functions?

You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code).

## My Turn

I'll create a function to import each year of data math proficiency data, then use `bind_rows()` to bind them together

## Your Turn

1. Create a function to import each year of data enrollment data, then use `bind_rows()` to bind them together

--

1. In addition to the argument for year, you'll need to use an argument to use in the `str_remove()` section of your code.

# Data Merging

---

## Data Merging

All of the animations and explanations used here come from the [tidyexplain project by Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/).


---

## Data Merging

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
german_speakers_2019 <- german_speakers %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -state,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = na_if(number, "-")) %>% 
  mutate(number = replace_na(number, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>% 
  mutate(year = parse_number(year)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  select(-year)
```



```{r eval = TRUE}
german_speakers_2019
```

---

## Data Merging

```{r eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
french_speakers_2019 <- read_excel(path = here("data-raw", "German and French Speakers.xlsx"),
                              sheet = "French speakers 2019")
```

```{r include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
french_speakers_2019 <- read_excel(path = "data-raw/German and French Speakers.xlsx",
                              sheet = "French speakers 2019")
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
french_speakers_2019
```

---

## Joins

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = "id_variable")
```

--

What if we don't have a variable with the same name in both data frames?

--

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = c("id_variable_x" = "id_variable_y")
```

--

What if we need to join on multiple variables with different names in both data frames?

--

```{r}
type_of_join <- (x, y,
                 by = c("id_variable_a" = "id_variable_b",
                        "id_variable_c" = "id_variable_d")
```

---

## Which join should I use?

![](images/claus-wilke-left-join.png)


---

## Mutating joins

> A mutating join allows you to combine variables from two tables. It first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one table to the other. - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#mutating-joins)

---

### `left_join()`

All rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns.

.center[
![](images/left-join.gif)
]



---

### `left_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
left_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```

---

### `right_join()`

All rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns.
.center[
![](images/right-join.gif)
]



---

### `right_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
right_join(german_speakers_2019,
           french_speakers_2019,
           by = "state")
```

---

### `full_join()`

All rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.
.center[
![](images/full-join.gif)
]

---

### `full_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
full_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```


---

### `inner_join()`

All rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.
.center[
![](images/inner-join.gif)
]

---

### `inner_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
inner_join(german_speakers_2019,
           french_speakers_2019,
           by = "state")
```

---

## Filtering joins

> Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins)

---

### `semi_join()`

All rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
.center[
![](images/semi-join.gif)
]

---

### `semi_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
semi_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```

---

### `anti_join()`

All rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
.center[
![](images/anti-join.gif)
]

---

### `anti_join()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
anti_join(german_speakers_2019,
          french_speakers_2019,
          by = "state")
```
